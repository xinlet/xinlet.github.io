(You can pronounce my name as "Shin-Lee")

Current Position
======

I am currently a Principal Biostatistician at Novartis. 

I completed my PhD at University of Bath, where my research focused on sparse statistical models for high-dimensional data.

I was under the supervision of [Dr. Sandipan Roy](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/sandipan-roy/) and [Professor Matt Nunes](https://people.bath.ac.uk/man54/homepage.html), with [Dr. Alex Gibberd](https://sites.google.com/view/gibberd/) as an external advisor during my PhD.

I am open to a wide range of academic collaborations and would be glad to explore potential opportunities.
